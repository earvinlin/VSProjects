This is a test file.

For my Learning Windows Programming using C / C++.

I must use it to write any codes that I want to do!!!

================================================

The number of words is too few
so I have to write more 
By the way, not support non-ascii code
today, i see plug-in web page
the skill is too hard
I'm too far behind
but now I do it for fun
therefore, there won't be too much unnecessay pressure
instead, I am calm and happy now.
